#Create a class named Triangle.
#Create an object from it. The object will have three attributes named a, b and c that represent the sides of the triangle.
#The Triangle class will have two methods:
the init method to initialize the sides
a method to calculate the perimeter of the triangle from its sides
#The perimeter of the triangle should be printed from outside the class.

class Triangle:  
    def __init__(self, a, b, c):  
        self.a = a  
        self.b = b  
        self.c = c  
        pass  # Placeholder  

    def perimeter(self):  
        return self.a + self.b + self.c  

# Creating an object of Triangle  
t1 = Triangle(3, 4, 5)  

# Printing the perimeter of the triangle  
print("Perimeter of the triangle:", t1.perimeter())
